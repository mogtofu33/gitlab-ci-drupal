## Quick setup

[Gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com) offer some CI pipeline minutes/month on free accounts.

- Copy [starter.gitlab-ci.yml](https://gitlab.com/mog33/gitlab-ci-drupal/-/raw/4.x-dev/starter.gitlab-ci.yml)
file as a `.gitlab-ci.yml` at the root of your Drupal module or theme
(same level as `my_module_or_theme.info.yml` file).
- If your project is not on [Gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com), edit the `include` section et the beginning.
- Edit the `variables` and uncomment the section under `Override default variables for a module`
- Create and push your branch, see the pipeline running for basic code standard and lint.

- If you are using _Behat_ you must add your tests in a `behat_tests` folders at the root of your Drupal project (same level as `composer.json` file).
  - As a starting point you can look in the [behat_tests](./behat_tests) folder of this project.
