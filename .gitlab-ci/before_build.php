 * See RoboFile.php and https://robo.li/ documentation to run a task.

 * This file is executed BEFORE the Build job script, ie:
 * `composer install / require`, so it's not recommended for a composer task
 * but more any pre-build task.
 *
 * It's important to have any action relative to the docRoot or webRoot as we
 * are not working from the CI_PROJECT_DIR.
